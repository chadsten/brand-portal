1 - review the Features in whole, and generate a high-level architecture document for the WHOLE APP for me to review and then a more detailed document for each system.
2 - generate a detailed human-friendly summary of how it will work, with use-case examples or user stories so i can confirm you understand everything. propose creating Phases for the tasks for each system as you see fit.
3 - then you should generate a detailed plan that YOU will consume for each feature. break it down into chunked instructions like my example below. 
    A. at the top of this file, write yourself a note "DO NOT CHANGE ANYTHING IN THIS FILE OTHER THAN CHECKING OFF A TASK" and then you will use the task plan to do your work, review your work after it is done, mark it as complete, and then move on.
