- Use HeroUI under import {} from "@heroui/react" for all UI components when possible.
- When you are making new UI components look for examples in the Context7 MCP under Library ID: /daisyui/
- The only npm scripts you need to run are:
  - `npm run typecheck` - checks for type errors
  - `npm run check` - checks for linting errors
