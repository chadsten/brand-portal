- When you are making new UI components look for examples in the Context7 MCP under Library ID: /saadeghi/daisyui
- The only npm scripts you need to run are:
  - `npm run typecheck` - checks for type errors
  - `npm run check` - checks for linting errors
- Do not make Drizzle migrations it is setup as code only.
