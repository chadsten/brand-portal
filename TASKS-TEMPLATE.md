INSTRUCTIONS:
At the top of your *-TASKS.md file(s), write yourself a note "DO NOT CHANGE ANYTHING IN THIS FILE OTHER THAN CHECKING OFF A TASK" and then you will use the task list to do your work, review your work after it is done, mark it as complete, and then move on to the next step.

RULES FOR TASKS:
1. Do not leave ANY legacy or compatability layers; your steps should FULLY refactor the application to fit whatever new or changed system we're interacting with.
2. Do not be lazy or cut corners!
3. Do not make things up that I didn't ask for (stats that don't do anything, adding new skills, etc). Stick to scope!
4. USE SEQUENTIAL THIKNING OFTEN!
