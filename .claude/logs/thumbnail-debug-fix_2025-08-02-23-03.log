GOAL: Investigate and fix the completely broken thumbnail functionality in the asset management system

IMPLEMENTATION: 
Performed forensic analysis of the thumbnail system to identify the root cause:

1. **AssetGrid Component Analysis**: 
   - getThumbnailUrl() function generates `/api/assets/${asset.id}/thumbnail` when asset.thumbnailKey exists
   - Falls back to `/api/assets/${asset.id}/download` for images without thumbnailKey
   - Component logic was correct

2. **Database Investigation**:
   - Successfully seeded 37 test assets into database  
   - Found that image assets had thumbnailKey values set to fake paths like `test-thumbnails/${uuid}-thumb.jpg`

3. **API Endpoint Testing**:
   - Thumbnail endpoint requires authentication (401 Unauthorized for direct curl)
   - Endpoint logic was correct - tries to serve thumbnailKey file from storage, falls back to original for images

4. **Root Cause Identified**:
   - Line 657 in seed.ts was setting fake thumbnailKey values: `thumbnailKey: assetData.fileType === "image" ? \`test-thumbnails/\${randomUUID()}-thumb.jpg\` : null`
   - Database had thumbnailKey references to non-existent files in storage
   - AssetGrid generated thumbnail URLs that pointed to non-existent files
   - Storage system correctly returned 404 for missing thumbnail files

5. **Fix Applied**:
   - Updated seed.ts line 657 to: `thumbnailKey: null, // Don't set fake thumbnail keys - let images use original file`
   - Created fix-thumbnails-simple.sql to clear existing fake thumbnailKey values
   - Created fix-thumbnail-data.js script for programmatic cleanup
   
6. **Solution**:
   - Images will now use original files as thumbnails via /download endpoint
   - No fake storage references in database
   - Thumbnails will work immediately after data cleanup

NEXT STEPS:
1. Run fix-thumbnails-simple.sql or re-seed database to clear fake thumbnailKey values
2. Verify thumbnails work in browser
3. Consider implementing actual thumbnail generation for production use
