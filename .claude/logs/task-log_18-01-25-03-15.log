GOAL: Phase 2.4 (4.4) - Upload UI Components
Create comprehensive upload UI components with HeroUI for drag-and-drop uploads, progress tracking, file validation, and bulk upload management.

IMPLEMENTATION:
1. Created FileDropzone.tsx - Core drag-and-drop upload component
   - Supports both direct and chunked uploads based on file size (5MB threshold)
   - Real-time upload progress tracking
   - File preview for images
   - Built with HeroUI components and react-dropzone
   - Integrated with tRPC for upload API calls

2. Created UploadProgress.tsx - Upload progress tracking component
   - Real-time progress monitoring for individual files and jobs
   - Job management with retry, cancel, pause, and resume functionality
   - Time estimates and upload speed calculations
   - Detailed progress visualization

3. Created UploadManager.tsx - Combined upload interface
   - Tabbed interface (Upload, Progress, Settings)
   - Upload job management and statistics
   - Minimizable interface for background operations
   - Integration with all upload components

4. Created FilePreview.tsx - File preview component
   - Modal-based preview for images, videos, and PDFs
   - Responsive design with proper fallbacks
   - Download and asset management capabilities

5. Created FileValidator.tsx - File validation system
   - Comprehensive validation rules (size, type, name, security)
