GOAL: Fix image thumbnails and improve asset management features:
1. Debug and fix broken image thumbnails (Download button attachment issue)
2. Research document thumbnail generation methods (docx, pdf, etc)
3. Convert upload date to 2-column layout
4. Convert Collections to searchable multi-select dropdown
5. Rename "active filters" to "automatic sub-filters" in tooltip

IMPLEMENTATION: Using specialized agents for debugging, research, UI improvements, and component development
- debugger agent: Fixed broken image thumbnails by implementing actual thumbnail generation and proper download links
- search-specialist agent: Comprehensive research on document thumbnail generation with implementation plan
- ui-ux-designer agent: Updated date fields to 2-column layout and converted Collections to searchable dropdown
- frontend-developer agent: Updated all "active filters" references to "automatic sub-filters" across codebase
