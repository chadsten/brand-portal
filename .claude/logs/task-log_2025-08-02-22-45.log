GOAL: Rename "active filters" to "automatic sub-filters" in tooltip/badge text throughout the codebase to better communicate their purpose to users.

IMPLEMENTATION: 
1. Searched codebase for all instances of "active filters" text using case-insensitive grep
2. Updated the following components:
   - AssetBrowser.tsx: Updated comment and tooltip text for clear button
   - SearchFilters.tsx: Updated comment and display text in filters summary
   - AdvancedSearch.tsx: Updated comment
   - CollectionBrowser.tsx: Updated comment and display text
   - AssetFilters.tsx: Updated header text

3. Changes made:
   - Comments: "Active Filters" → "Automatic Sub-Filters"
   - Display text: "Active Filters:" → "Automatic Sub-Filters:"
   - Display text: "Active filters:" → "Automatic sub-filters:"
   - Tooltip: "Clear all filters" → "Clear all automatic sub-filters"

All instances in source code successfully updated. Log file references left unchanged as they are historical records.
