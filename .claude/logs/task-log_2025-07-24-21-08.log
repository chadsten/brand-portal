  * Button → button with DaisyUI btn classes
  * Card/CardBody → div with card/card-body classes  
  * Chip/Badge → span with badge classes
  * Modal → dialog with DaisyUI modal structure
  * Input/Select/Textarea → native form elements with DaisyUI styling
  * Checkbox/Switch → input elements with DaisyUI classes
  * Dropdown → div with dropdown classes
  * Progress → progress element
  * Tabs → radio-based tab structure
- Replaced useDisclosure hook with custom useModal hook
- Updated event handlers: onPress → onClick, onValueChange → onChange
- Maintained all functionality while switching to CSS-only framework

KEY FILES CONVERTED:
