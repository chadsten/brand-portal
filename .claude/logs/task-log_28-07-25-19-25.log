GOAL: Convert ThemeSettings.tsx from HeroUI to DaisyUI components systematically

IMPLEMENTATION: 
- Removed ALL @heroui/react imports (Badge, Button, Card, CardBody, CardHeader, Chip, Divider, Input, Modal, ModalBody, ModalContent, ModalFooter, ModalHeader, Select, SelectItem, Slider, Switch, Tab, Tabs, useDisclosure)
- Replaced useDisclosure with useModal hook from ~/hooks/useModal
- Converted Modal/ModalContent/ModalHeader/ModalBody/ModalFooter to native dialog elements with DaisyUI modal classes and proper backdrop click handling
- Converted Card/CardBody/CardHeader to div elements with DaisyUI card classes (card, card-body, card-header)
- Converted Button components to native button elements with DaisyUI btn classes (btn, btn-primary, btn-ghost, btn-sm)
- Converted Badge/Chip components to span elements with DaisyUI badge classes (badge, badge-ghost, badge-warning)
- Converted Tabs/Tab to DaisyUI tabs pattern using state-based tab navigation with tab-lifted styling
- Converted Select/SelectItem to native select/option elements with DaisyUI select classes
- Converted Slider to input type="range" with DaisyUI range classes (range, range-primary)
- Converted Input components to native input elements with DaisyUI input classes (input, input-bordered, input-sm)
- Converted Divider to div with DaisyUI divider class
- Updated all event handlers (onPress → onClick, onValueChange → onChange)
- Updated text styling classes from HeroUI to DaisyUI equivalents (text-default-500 → text-base-content/70, text-small → text-sm)
- Added proper modal reference handling with useRef for native dialog API
- Maintained all existing functionality including theme mode selection, presets, color customization, spacing controls, border radius settings, import/export functionality
