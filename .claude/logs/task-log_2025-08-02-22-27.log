GOAL: Add a "Clear all filters" button beside the search on the main AssetBrowser page that only appears when there are active filters and clears all filters when clicked.

IMPLEMENTATION: 
1. Added RotateCcw icon import from lucide-react to the existing imports in AssetBrowser.tsx
2. Created a new handleClearAllFilters callback function that resets filters to an empty object and resets the current page to 1
3. Added a conditional "Clear all filters" button next to the Filters button that:
   - Only displays when activeFilterCount > 0 (ensuring it only shows when filters are active)
   - Uses btn-error styling with btn-outline and btn-sm classes to match the existing Filters button
   - Includes the RotateCcw icon and "Clear all" text
   - Has a helpful title attribute for accessibility
   - Calls handleClearAllFilters when clicked
4. Positioned the button logically between the Filters button and Sort dropdown in the search/filters row
5. Used consistent DaisyUI styling that matches the existing UI components

The implementation follows React best practices with:
- Proper useCallback usage for performance optimization
- Conditional rendering based on filter state
- Consistent styling with existing components
- Clear separation of concerns with dedicated handler function
- Accessibility considerations with title attribute
