GOAL: Debug and fix authentication issues - user reported being logged in as hardcoded "Sarah" user, logout button not working, and errors when accessing signin URL.

IMPLEMENTATION: 
1. **Analyzed authentication flow issues**: Found hardcoded MOCK_USER "Sarah Chen" in AppLayout.tsx bypassing real authentication
2. **Removed mock user data**: Eliminated hardcoded user and implemented real NextAuth session integration
3. **Fixed session management**: Updated AppLayout.tsx to use useSession() from next-auth/react with proper user data mapping
4. **Implemented proper logout**: Added signOut() functionality with correct callback URL and error handling  
5. **Added SessionProvider**: Updated Providers component to include NextAuth SessionProvider wrapping entire app
6. **Environment configuration**: Updated .env with correct NEXTAUTH_URL for development testing
7. **Server management**: Started development server on available port 3004 for testing

**Key Code Changes:**
- **AppLayout.tsx**: Removed MOCK_USER, added useSession(), implemented handleLogout with signOut()
- **src/contexts/index.tsx**: Added SessionProvider import and wrapped app with NextAuth context
- **.env**: Updated NEXTAUTH_URL and NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL to match server port
- **Authentication flow**: Now uses real database users with credentials provider for test emails

**Test Credentials Available:**
- admin@test.com (admin role)  
- user1@test.com through user5@test.com (regular users)

**Authentication Architecture:**
- Real NextAuth sessions with database adapter
- Credentials provider for development testing
- Proper session callbacks with user ID and organization mapping
- Functional logout with redirect to signin page
