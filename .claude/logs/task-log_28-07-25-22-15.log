GOAL: Complete comprehensive mock data enhancement with all entity types

IMPLEMENTATION:
Successfully implemented comprehensive mock data system with full support for all entity types:

1. NEW ENTITY TYPES ADDED:
   - Organization: Company/team data with subscription plans, settings, industry classification
   - Gallery: Image/asset galleries with permissions, layout options, view/like/share counts
   - Project: Brand projects with status tracking, progress, budget, team assignments
   - BrandGuideline: Complete brand guideline documents with logo, colors, typography, voice
   - Comment: User comments on assets/collections/galleries/projects with reactions
   - Review: User reviews with ratings for assets and collections
   - ApprovalWorkflow: Configurable approval processes with multi-step workflows
   - ApprovalRequest: Individual approval requests with step-by-step tracking
   - UsageAnalytics: Detailed usage tracking with device type, location, referrer data

2. MOCK DATA GENERATORS CREATED:
   - generateOrganization(): 10 realistic organizations with varying sizes and plans
   - generateGallery(): 20 galleries with different types (public/private/shared)
   - generateProject(): 15 projects with realistic timelines and progress tracking
   - generateBrandGuideline(): 8 complete brand guideline documents
   - generateComment(): 100 realistic user comments with reactions
   - generateReview(): 50 user reviews with ratings and verification status
   - generateApprovalWorkflow(): 5 configurable approval workflows
   - generateApprovalRequest(): 25 approval requests with step tracking
   - generateUsageAnalytics(): 500 usage analytics entries with device/location data

3. ENHANCED SAMPLE DATA:
   - Added sample organizations (TechCorp, Creative Solutions, etc.)
   - Added sample industries (Technology, Healthcare, Finance, etc.)
   - Added sample project names and gallery collections
   - Added realistic comment content and color palettes
   - Enhanced user profiles with more realistic data

4. UPDATED MOCK DATA SYSTEM:
   - generateMockData() now creates comprehensive dataset with all entities
   - Enhanced statistics with new metrics (totalOrganizations, totalProjects, etc.)
   - Added relationship mapping (assets ↔ galleries, users ↔ organizations)
   - Updated storage counts: 250 assets, 30 collections, 25 users, 20 galleries, 15 projects

5. UPDATED useMockData HOOK:
   - Extended MockDataState interface with all new entity types
   - Updated persistence layer to save/restore all entity types with proper date handling
   - Enhanced stats calculation with new metrics (activeProjects, pendingApprovals, etc.)
   - Added support for comprehensive data reset including all new entities

6. UTILITY FUNCTIONS ADDED:
   - getOrganizationById(), getProjectsByStatus(), getGalleriesByType()
   - getActiveBrandGuidelines(), getCommentsByTarget(), getReviewsByTarget()
   - getApprovalRequestsByStatus(), getUsageAnalyticsByAction()
   - getUsageAnalyticsDateRange() for date-filtered analytics

7. TYPE SAFETY:
   - All generators properly typed with TypeScript interfaces
   - Comprehensive error handling and fallbacks for missing data
   - Optional override parameters for customization
   - Proper date handling in persistence layer

TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION:
- Used realistic random data generation with proper distributions
- Implemented cross-entity relationships (projects ↔ assets, galleries ↔ assets)
- Added proper date range generation for realistic timestamps  
- Used consistent ID generation and cross-referencing
- Optimized for performance with proper array operations
- Enhanced with realistic metadata (user agents, IP addresses, locations)

QUALITY ASSURANCE:
- All TypeScript compilation errors resolved
- Proper code formatting and documentation
- Consistent naming conventions throughout
- Comprehensive test data for development and testing
