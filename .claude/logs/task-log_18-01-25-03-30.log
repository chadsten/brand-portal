GOAL: Phase 3.1 (5.1) - Asset Database Operations
Implement comprehensive asset management system with CRUD operations, search/filtering, permissions, and versioning capabilities.

IMPLEMENTATION:
1. Asset Database Schema Design
   - Leveraged existing comprehensive schema with assets, assetVersions, and assetPermissions tables
   - Full relational design with proper indexing for performance
   - Support for soft deletes, metadata, and organization-scoped access

2. Asset CRUD Operations with tRPC
   - Created complete asset router (~/server/api/routers/asset.ts)
   - Asset creation with usage validation and automatic metrics tracking
   - Asset retrieval by ID with permission checks
   - Asset updates for metadata (title, description, tags)
   - Soft delete functionality with usage metrics updates
   - Comprehensive error handling and validation

3. Search and Filtering Capabilities
   - Advanced search across title, filename, description
   - Multi-criteria filtering: file types, tags, uploader, date ranges
   - Efficient pagination with total count and hasMore indicators
   - Flexible sorting by createdAt, updatedAt, title, fileSize, fileName
   - JSON-based tag search using PostgreSQL operators
   - Performance-optimized queries with proper indexing

4. Asset Permissions Management System
   - Role-based and user-based permission control
   - Granular permissions: view, download, edit, delete
   - Permission inheritance (uploaders have full access)
   - Organization-scoped permission validation
   - Set and retrieve permissions with comprehensive validation

5. Asset Versioning System
   - Automatic version numbering and tracking
   - Version creation with change logs
   - Version history with uploader information
   - Storage key management for version files
   - Seamless integration with asset lifecycle

6. Additional Features Implemented
   - Asset statistics endpoint for dashboard metrics
   - Popular tags extraction and counting
   - Usage validation and quota enforcement
   - Integration with storage and upload systems
   - Type-safe tRPC procedures with Zod validation

Key Endpoints Created:
- asset.create - Create new assets with validation
- asset.getById - Retrieve asset with full details and versions
- asset.search - Advanced search and filtering with pagination
- asset.update - Update asset metadata
- asset.delete - Soft delete assets
- asset.createVersion - Create new asset versions
- asset.getVersions - Retrieve version history
- asset.setPermissions - Manage asset permissions
- asset.getPermissions - Retrieve permission details
- asset.getStats - Organization asset statistics
- asset.getPopularTags - Popular tags for categorization

Security Features:
- Organization-scoped access control
- Permission validation on all operations
- Input validation with Zod schemas
- SQL injection protection with Drizzle ORM
- Soft delete for data integrity

Performance Optimizations:
- Efficient database queries with proper indexing
- Pagination for large datasets
- Usage metrics caching and scheduling
- Optimized JSON queries for tag filtering

Integration Points:
- Storage system for file management
- Usage tracking for quota enforcement
- Upload system for asset creation
- Download system for asset serving
