GOAL: Fix sign out button that was not working when clicked - investigate and resolve the issue preventing user logout

IMPLEMENTATION: 
- Analyzed codebase structure and located sign out buttons in MainNavigation.tsx (lines 323 and 433)
- Found both mobile menu and desktop dropdown sign out buttons were using <a> elements without proper href attributes
- Identified that anchor elements without href still trigger browser navigation behavior, interfering with onClick handlers
- Verified NextAuth v5 configuration and signOut function integration was correct in AppLayout.tsx
- Confirmed the handleLogout function properly calls NextAuth's signOut with correct parameters (callbackUrl: "/api/auth/signin", redirect: true)
- Root cause: HTML semantic issue where <a> elements were preventing onClick events from firing reliably
- Solution: Converted both sign out <a> elements to proper <button> elements with:
  - type="button" attribute to prevent form submission
  - Proper styling classes for consistent UI behavior
  - Same onClick handlers that call the working NextAuth signOut function
- Files modified: src/components/navigation/MainNavigation.tsx (lines 322-331 and 436-445)
