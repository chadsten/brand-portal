GOAL: Investigate why assets aren't showing up in the brand portal despite successful seed script execution. Perform comprehensive database analysis to identify visibility issues and provide actionable recommendations.

IMPLEMENTATION: 
1. Database Query Analysis:
   - Count total assets in brand_portal_assets table
   - Examine recent assets with full details
   - Check for soft-deleted assets (deletedAt not null)
   - Verify organizationId and uploadedBy field validity
   - Analyze processing status distribution
   - Check organization distribution

2. Common Visibility Issue Investigation:
   - Organization mismatch analysis
   - Permission verification
   - Processing status blocking display
   - Soft-deletion status check

3. Data Quality Assessment:
   - Field validation and integrity
   - Relationship consistency
   - Status field analysis

STARTED: 2025-08-02-20-42
COMPLETED: 2025-08-02-20-42

FINDINGS:
1. Database Status: ✅ HEALTHY
   - 340 assets successfully imported
   - All assets have completed processing status
   - No soft-deleted assets
   - All organizationId and uploadedBy references are valid
   - No orphaned data found

2. Data Integrity: ✅ EXCELLENT
   - Single organization (Test Company) with ID: b614723b-8b45-4b3b-bcc4-996d04bcb25f
   - 5 test users properly linked to organization
   - All assets properly categorized (images, documents, videos, audio)
   - Storage keys and metadata properly populated

3. Authentication Issue: ❌ ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED
   - NO ACTIVE SESSIONS found in brand_portal_session table
   - NO ACCOUNTS found in brand_portal_account table
   - Users exist but are not authenticated via NextAuth

4. API Protection: The asset.search endpoint uses protectedProcedure
   - Requires valid session with organizationId
   - Without authentication, users cannot access the API

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. IMMEDIATE: Fix authentication setup
2. Test user login flow
3. Verify NextAuth configuration
4. Check environment variables for auth providers
