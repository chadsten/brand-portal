GOAL: Fix asset filtering issue where image filter shows no results despite having images

IMPLEMENTATION:
1. **Investigated filter architecture**:
   - Frontend: AssetBrowser component uses AssetFilters for UI
   - Backend: asset.search tRPC endpoint handles filtering logic
   - Frontend sends MIME types array (e.g., ["image/jpeg", "image/png"])
   - Backend processes filters in WHERE clause construction

2. **Root cause identified**:
   - **Issue**: Backend was filtering `assets.fileType` against MIME type values
   - **Database reality**: 
     * `fileType` contains categorical values: "image", "document", "video"
     * `mimeType` contains specific MIME types: "image/jpeg", "image/png"
   - **Filter mismatch**: Frontend sends ["image/jpeg", "image/png"] but backend compared against fileType="image"
   - **Result**: No matches found, all assets filtered out

3. **Solution implemented**:
   - **Fixed backend filter**: Changed `inArray(assets.fileType, input.fileTypes)` to `inArray(assets.mimeType, input.fileTypes)`
   - **Enhanced frontend filter**: Added `image/svg+xml` to image types to include SVG files
   - **Verified fix**: Confirmed database has 10+ image assets with correct MIME types

4. **Database verification**:
   - Found image assets with MIME types: image/jpeg, image/png, image/gif, image/svg+xml
   - Tested filter logic returns correct results
   - All existing image assets now properly filtered

**Files modified**:
- `src/server/api/routers/asset.ts:318` - Fixed filter to use mimeType instead of fileType
- `src/components/assets/AssetFilters.tsx:39` - Added image/svg+xml to image filter types

**Impact**:
- ✅ Image filter now works correctly  
- ✅ All MIME type filters (video, audio, document) now work
- ✅ SVG images included in image filter
- ✅ No assets incorrectly filtered out
