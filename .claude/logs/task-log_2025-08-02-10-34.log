GOAL: Fix database connection error - application unable to connect to PostgreSQL, showing "password authentication failed" error

IMPLEMENTATION: 
1. **Identified the root cause**: Port and password mismatch in environment configuration
   - .env was using port 5433 with password "password"
   - .env.local was using port 5432 with password "password"
   - Actual PostgreSQL container on port 5432 uses password "exotheterrible"

2. **Updated configuration files**:
   - Changed DATABASE_URL in .env from port 5433 to 5432
   - Updated password from "password" to "exotheterrible" in both .env and .env.local
   - Ensured consistency between both environment files

3. **Verified database availability**:
   - Confirmed PostgreSQL container is running on port 5432
   - Verified brand_portal database exists in the container
   - Redis connection remains healthy

**Next Steps**:
- Server needs to be restarted to load new environment variables
- Once restarted, the database connection should work properly
