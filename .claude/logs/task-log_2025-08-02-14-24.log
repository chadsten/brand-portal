GOAL: Troubleshoot why thumbnails still not showing after implementing API endpoints

IMPLEMENTATION:
1. **Fixed download endpoint storage method**:
   - Identified that download endpoint was using non-existent `getFileStream` method
   - Updated to use `storageManager.downloadFile` matching thumbnail endpoint
   - Fixed response headers to use result from downloadFile

2. **Investigated storage connectivity**:
   - Found MinIO was not running (connection refused on port 9000)
   - Started MinIO service using docker-compose dev configuration
   - Verified MinIO is now accessible

3. **Root cause analysis**:
   - Database contains image assets with thumbnail_key and storage_key values
   - Example keys: `test-thumbnails/60683170-7e2a-41e9-8232-08b63024aa32-thumb.jpg`
   - Storage manager correctly implemented and accessible
   - **ISSUE IDENTIFIED**: Files referenced by storage keys do not exist in MinIO storage

4. **Confirmed diagnosis**:
   - Used `storageManager.getFileInfo()` to test both thumbnail and original file keys
   - Both returned `exists: false`
   - Database contains seed/test data with mock storage keys
   - No actual image files uploaded to MinIO storage

**Root Cause**: The asset database entries are seed data with placeholder storage keys that don't correspond to actual files in MinIO. The thumbnail API endpoints work correctly, but return 404 because the referenced files don't exist.

**Resolution Options**:
1. Upload actual image files matching the database keys
2. Update seed data to clear storage keys for non-existent files
3. Implement proper file upload workflow for real assets
