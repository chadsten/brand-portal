GOAL: Phase 3.2 (5.2) - Asset Metadata and Tagging
Implement comprehensive metadata management system with advanced tagging, metadata extraction, search indexing, and auto-tagging capabilities.

IMPLEMENTATION:
1. Metadata Schema and Indexing Strategy
   - Created comprehensive metadata schema (~/server/db/schema/metadata.ts)
   - Hierarchical tags table with parent-child relationships
   - Asset-tag junction table with confidence scores and sources
   - Metadata templates for consistent metadata across asset types
   - Extended asset metadata table for technical and AI-extracted data
   - Search index table for full-text search capabilities
   - Tag groups for organizing and managing exclusive tags
   - Auto-tag rules table for automated tagging

2. Advanced Tagging System with Hierarchical Tags
   - Created TaggingService (~/server/services/metadata/tagging.ts)
   - Hierarchical tag management with parent-child relationships
   - Tag slug generation with uniqueness guarantees
   - Exclusive tag groups (only one tag from group allowed)
   - Tag usage counting and popularity tracking
   - Tag permissions and organization scoping
   - Batch tag operations with validation

3. Metadata Extraction Services
   - Created MetadataExtractionService (~/server/services/metadata/extractor.ts)
   - Image metadata extractor using Sharp library
     - Dimensions, transparency, animation detection
     - EXIF data extraction for JPEG images
     - Dominant color and palette extraction
     - Aspect ratio and megapixel calculations
   - Video metadata extractor (placeholder for ffmpeg integration)
   - Document metadata extractor (placeholder for pdf-parse integration)
   - Extensible architecture for adding new extractors
   - Batch metadata extraction with concurrency control

4. Search Indexing with Full-text Search
   - Created SearchIndexingService (~/server/services/metadata/search.ts)
   - Content indexing from multiple sources (title, description, tags, metadata)
   - Full-text search with relevance scoring
   - Advanced filtering (file types, tags, date ranges, size)
   - Search aggregations for faceted search
   - Search highlighting with excerpt generation
   - Search suggestions/autocomplete functionality
   - Organization-wide reindexing capabilities

5. Auto-tagging and AI-powered Suggestions
   - Tag suggestion system with multiple sources:
     - File type-based suggestions
     - Similar asset analysis
     - Auto-tag rules engine
     - AI-based suggestions (placeholder for integration)
   - Auto-tag rules with complex conditions:
     - Field-based matching (equals, contains, regex, etc.)
     - AND/OR logic for conditions
     - Priority-based rule execution
     - Apply to existing assets option
   - Confidence scoring for suggested tags
   - Source tracking (manual, ai, auto, system)

6. Metadata tRPC Router
   - Created comprehensive metadata router (~/server/api/routers/metadata.ts)
   - Tag management endpoints (create, hierarchy, search)
   - Tag application and removal with validation
   - Tag suggestions with configurable sources
   - Tag group management
   - Auto-tag rule CRUD operations
   - Metadata extraction and reprocessing
   - Full-text search with filtering and aggregations
   - Search suggestions/autocomplete
   - Asset reindexing capabilities
   - Custom metadata updates

Key Features Implemented:
- Hierarchical tag system with parent-child relationships
- Exclusive tag groups for mutually exclusive categorization
- Multi-source tag suggestions with confidence scoring
- Extensible metadata extraction framework
- Full-text search with relevance scoring
- Faceted search with aggregations
- Auto-tagging rules engine
- Batch operations for efficiency
- Complete type safety with Zod validation

Integration Points:
- Asset management system for metadata association
- Storage system for file access during extraction
- Search functionality for asset discovery
- UI components for tag management (to be implemented)

Performance Optimizations:
- Efficient database queries with proper indexing
- Batch operations for bulk processing
- Caching for frequently accessed data
- Concurrent processing with configurable limits
- Incremental search indexing

Security Features:
- Organization-scoped access control
- Permission validation on all operations
- Input sanitization and validation
- SQL injection protection
