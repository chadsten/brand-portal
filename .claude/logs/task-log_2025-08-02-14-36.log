GOAL: Download real images and upload them to storage for thumbnail display

IMPLEMENTATION:
1. **Downloaded sample images from web**:
   - Used Lorem Picsum (https://picsum.photos) for random sample images
   - Downloaded 4 different images matching database asset IDs:
     * Instagram Story Template.jpg (800x600)
     * Website Header Image.png (1200x400) 
     * Team Member Portrait.jpg (600x600)
     * Product Photo - Main.jpg (800x800)
   - All images successfully downloaded as Buffer objects

2. **Set up MinIO storage infrastructure**:
   - Started MinIO Docker container using docker-compose dev configuration
   - Created `brand-portal-dev` bucket using MinIO client (mc)
   - Verified MinIO accessible on localhost:9000

3. **Configured storage manager for MinIO**:
   - Added `AWS_ENDPOINT` environment variable support to src/env.js
   - Updated StorageManager default config to include MinIO endpoint when AWS_ENDPOINT is set
   - Added `AWS_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:9000` to .env.local
   - Enabled forcePathStyle for S3-compatible storage

4. **Uploaded images to correct storage locations**:
   - Matched uploaded files to existing database storage keys
   - Original files: `test-assets/[uuid]-[filename]`
   - Thumbnails: `test-thumbnails/[uuid]-thumb.jpg`
   - All 4 images with their thumbnails successfully uploaded

5. **Infrastructure improvements**:
   - Added AWS_ENDPOINT to environment schema validation
   - Enhanced storage manager constructor to conditionally include MinIO endpoint
   - Created reusable MinIO configuration pattern for development

**Results**:
- ✅ 4 real images downloaded and uploaded to MinIO storage
- ✅ 4 thumbnails generated and uploaded 
- ✅ Storage manager now correctly configured for MinIO
- ✅ All database storage keys now point to actual files
- ✅ Thumbnail API endpoints return 401 (auth required) instead of 404 (not found)

**Next Steps**:
- Restart Next.js dev server to pick up environment variable changes
- Test thumbnail display in authenticated browser session
- Verify images display correctly in asset browser
