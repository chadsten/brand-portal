GOAL: Clean up modal UI system to be DRY and improve asset modal usability

IMPLEMENTATION:

   - Uses native HTML dialog element with DaisyUI styling
   - Built-in backdrop click handling and X button
   - Consistent sizing and positioning options
   - Proper accessibility with ESC key support

2. Updated AssetDetailModal (src/components/assets/AssetDetailModal.tsx)
   - Refactored to use BaseModal wrapper
   - Moved controls from header to below thumbnail (Download, Share, Edit, Delete)
   - Added "Add to Collection" button with FolderPlus icon
   - Moved "Upload Information" from Details tab to top of Versions tab
   - Cleaned up header to only show title and X close button

3. Updated AssetBrowser (src/components/assets/AssetBrowser.tsx)
   - Replaced custom dialog with BaseModal for filters modal
   - Updated AssetDetailModal integration to pass isOpen prop
   - Added CollectionSelectorModal integration

4. Updated Collection Modals
   - CollectionCreateModal: Converted to use BaseModal
   - CollectionDetailModal: Converted to use BaseModal
   - Removed manual backdrop and close button handling

5. Created CollectionSelectorModal (src/components/assets/CollectionSelectorModal.tsx)
   - Allows selecting multiple collections to add assets to
   - Search functionality for finding collections
   - Visual collection cards with checkboxes
   - Proper state management and API integration hooks
