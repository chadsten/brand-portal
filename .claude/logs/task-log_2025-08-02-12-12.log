GOAL: Fix authentication errors preventing assets from showing - 9 errors reported after login

IMPLEMENTATION: 
1. **Identified session strategy issue**: 
   - Credentials provider uses JWT sessions by default
   - But config had database session callback
   - Missing JWT callback to handle token data

2. **Fixed authentication configuration** in src/server/auth/config.ts:
   - Added `session: { strategy: "jwt" }` to explicitly use JWT sessions
   - Added `jwt` callback to store user id and organizationId in token
   - Updated `session` callback to work with JWT tokens instead of database sessions
   - Fixed TypeScript error by converting `null` to `undefined` for organizationId

3. **Key changes**:
   - organizationId: `user.organizationId || undefined` (converts null to undefined)
   - JWT callback: stores user data in token when user logs in
   - Session callback: reads from token instead of user parameter
   - Explicit JWT strategy for Credentials provider

**Result**: 
- TypeScript error in auth config is resolved
- Authentication now properly uses JWT sessions
- User session will contain correct organizationId from database
- Assets should be accessible after login

**Next Steps**:
- Server restart required to load new auth configuration
- User should log out and log back in to get new JWT token
