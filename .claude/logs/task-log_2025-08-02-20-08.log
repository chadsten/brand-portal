GOAL: Completely refactor the asset seeding script to make it dynamic and based on real file system data

IMPLEMENTATION: 
- Removed the hardcoded realAssets array entirely
- Created a dynamic system that scans the seed-assets/ folder and all subfolders recursively  
- Implemented real metadata extraction from files:
  * File size (actual file size using fs.statSync)
  * MIME type detection using file-type and mime-types libraries
  * Image metadata extraction using Sharp library (dimensions, color space, channels, etc.)
  * EXIF data extraction for JPEG images (camera info, settings, dates)
  * Video metadata extraction using ffprobe (duration, dimensions, codecs, bitrate)
  * Audio metadata extraction using ffprobe (duration, bitrate, tags, sample rate)
  * Document metadata (basic file stats and timestamps)
- Added intelligent file categorization by extension
- Implemented dynamic title/description generation from filenames
- Created robust error handling for unsupported formats
- Made the system completely extensible - any new files added to seed-assets/ folders automatically get included
- Added comprehensive logging and progress reporting
- Installed required metadata extraction libraries: file-type, probe-image-size, ffprobe-static, ffmpeg-static
- Successfully tested with 36 diverse file types across 4 categories (images: 10, documents: 17, audio: 3, video: 6)

TECHNICAL DETAILS:
- Recursive directory scanning using fs.readdirSync with { withFileTypes: true }
- Automatic file type categorization using extension mapping
- Real-time metadata extraction with fallback error handling
- Dynamic MIME type detection with multiple fallback methods
- Comprehensive metadata structure including source file paths and discovery timestamps
- Integration with existing database schema and seeding workflow
- Maintains all existing functionality while adding dynamic capabilities

PERFORMANCE RESULTS:
✅ Successfully processed 36 assets dynamically
✅ Extracted real file sizes (ranging from 0.2 KB to 154MB)
✅ Detected accurate MIME types automatically
✅ Generated appropriate titles and descriptions
✅ Integrated seamlessly with existing database schema
✅ Maintained backward compatibility with existing seeding workflow
