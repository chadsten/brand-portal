GOAL: Complete comprehensive overhaul of asset seeding system using agents for parallel execution. Ensure 100% file-examples.com coverage, dynamic file system-based seeding, and real database field alignment.

IMPLEMENTATION:
1. **Agent 1 - Comprehensive Website Audit**:
   - Systematically audited file-examples.com using sitemap and site structure
   - Discovered and downloaded 7 additional file types we were missing:
     * TIFF images
     * WebM, MOV, AVI, WMV videos  
     * JSON documents
     * ZIP archives
   - Created new /archives/ folder for compressed files
   - Achieved 100% coverage of all file types available on file-examples.com
   - Final count: 39 files across 7 categories

2. **Agent 2 - Complete Seed Script Refactoring**:
   - Eliminated 450+ lines of hardcoded `realAssets` array
   - Implemented dynamic file system scanning with recursive directory traversal
   - Added real metadata extraction using Sharp, ffprobe, file-type libraries
   - Created intelligent file categorization and title generation
   - Added comprehensive error handling and fallback mechanisms
   - Result: Fully dynamic system that auto-imports any files added to seed-assets/

3. **Agent 3 - Database Schema Verification**:
   - Verified all asset fields match database schema exactly:
     * organizationId, uploadedBy, fileName, originalFileName ✅
     * fileType, mimeType, fileSize, storageKey, thumbnailKey ✅
     * storageProvider, title, description, tags, metadata ✅
     * processingStatus, createdAt, updatedAt ✅
   - Confirmed seed script uses proper field names and data types
   - All relationships and foreign keys properly handled

4. **System Integration**:
   - Successfully tested new dynamic seed script with 37 assets
   - Proper MIME type detection for all file formats
   - Real file sizes extracted from actual files
   - Intelligent metadata extraction where possible
   - Graceful handling of unsupported formats

5. **Final File Coverage**:
   - Images: JPG, PNG, GIF, SVG, WebP, ICO, TIFF (10 files)
   - Videos: MP4, WebM, MOV, AVI, WMV (7 files)
   - Audio: MP3, WAV, OGG (3 files)
   - Documents: PDF, DOCX, XLSX, PPTX, HTML, CSS, XML, TXT, CSV, DOC, XLS, PPT, RTF, ODT, ODS, ODP (17 files)
   - Archives: ZIP (1 file, but filtered out during seeding)
   - JSON files (1 file, filtered out as unsupported)
