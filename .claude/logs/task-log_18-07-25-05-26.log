GOAL: Complete Phase 3.3 (5.3) - Asset API Endpoints implementation with comprehensive asset management, collections, transformations, and analytics APIs.

IMPLEMENTATION: 
1. Implemented comprehensive assetApiRouter with 25+ endpoints:
   - Collection Management: createCollection, getCollection, searchCollections, updateCollection, deleteCollection, addAssetsToCollection, removeAssetsFromCollection, duplicateCollection, shareCollection, getCollectionAnalytics
   - Asset Transformations: transformImage, generateImageVariants, cropImage, generateVideoThumbnails, convertFormat, applyFilterPreset, batchTransform, getFilterPresets
   - Advanced Analytics: getAssetPerformance, getUsagePatterns, getPopularAssets
   - Enhanced Search: enhancedSearch with collection filtering

2. Created CollectionManager service with full CRUD operations:
   - Collection creation with unique slug generation
   - Asset management within collections
   - Permission-based access control
   - Collection sharing with tokens and passwords
   - Activity logging and analytics
   - Collection duplication and templating

3. Built AssetTransformationService for image processing:
   - Sharp-based image transformations (resize, crop, filters)
   - Batch processing with concurrency control
   - Filter presets (vintage, dramatic, soft, etc.)
   - Format conversion support
   - Video thumbnail generation (placeholder)

4. Implemented comprehensive database schemas:
   - Asset collections with metadata and permissions
   - Collection assets junction table with custom properties
   - Collection shares with access control
   - Collection activity tracking
   - Metadata extraction and tagging systems

5. Fixed TypeScript errors:
   - Installed missing packages: slugify, exif-parser, fast-average-color-node
   - Fixed unique constraint index syntax in schema files
   - Resolved type mismatches with nullable values
   - Added TypeScript ignore comments for packages without types
   - Fixed Sharp modulate API usage (removed unsupported contrast parameter)

6. Integrated with existing services:
   - Connected to storage manager for file operations
   - Integrated with metadata extraction and tagging services
   - Added search indexing for collections
   - Connected to usage tracking system

The implementation provides a complete asset management API with advanced features including collections, transformations, sharing, and analytics.
