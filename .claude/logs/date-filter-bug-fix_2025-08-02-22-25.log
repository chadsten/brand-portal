GOAL: Fix the "Invalid time value" crash that occurs when clicking the Clear button on date filters in the AssetFilters component

PROBLEM ANALYSIS:
The issue was in the date handling logic around lines 261, 278, 476-477 in AssetFilters.tsx and lines 378-379 in AssetBrowser.tsx. The crash occurred when trying to call toISOString() and toLocaleDateString() on potentially undefined or invalid date values.

Specific issues identified:
1. Line 261: localFilters.dateRange?.from.toISOString().split("T")[0] - calling toISOString() without checking if 'from' is a valid Date
2. Line 278: localFilters.dateRange?.to.toISOString().split("T")[0] - same issue with 'to' date
3. Lines 476-477: Unsafe calls to toLocaleDateString() in filter summary display
4. Lines 378-379 in AssetBrowser.tsx: Similar unsafe date display calls

ROOT CAUSE:
When the Clear button was clicked, it would set dateRange to undefined, but subsequent renders could still have invalid Date objects in the dateRange properties, causing toISOString() and toLocaleDateString() to throw "Invalid time value" errors.

IMPLEMENTATION:
1. Added safe date utility functions at the top of AssetFilters.tsx:
   - formatDateForInput(date): Safely converts Date to YYYY-MM-DD format for input fields
   - formatDateForDisplay(date): Safely converts Date to localized string for display

2. Added similar formatDateForDisplay helper in AssetBrowser.tsx

3. Replaced all unsafe date method calls with safe helper function calls:
   - AssetFilters.tsx lines 261, 278: Replaced with formatDateForInput()
   - AssetFilters.tsx lines 476-477: Replaced with formatDateForDisplay()
   - AssetBrowser.tsx lines 378-379: Replaced with formatDateForDisplay()

4. The helper functions:
   - Check for null/undefined dates
   - Verify the date is a valid Date instance using instanceof
   - Check for invalid dates using isNaN(date.getTime())
   - Use try-catch blocks for additional safety
   - Return empty strings for invalid dates (matching existing fallback behavior)

TESTING:
- Ran npm run typecheck: No new TypeScript errors introduced
- Ran npm run check: No new linting errors related to our changes
- The fix is defensive and maintains existing functionality while preventing crashes

RESULT:
The date filters now safely handle all edge cases:
- Clear button works without crashes
- Invalid dates are gracefully handled
- Empty dates display as empty strings
- All existing functionality is preserved
