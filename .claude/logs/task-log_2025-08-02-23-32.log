GOAL: Restore non-image assets that were incorrectly soft-deleted during storage mismatch fix
- Analyze deleted assets to identify non-image types (PDFs, documents, etc.)
- Restore non-image assets by setting deleted_at back to NULL
- Keep image assets deleted that had actual storage mismatches
- Verify non-image assets display in UI with appropriate file type icons

IMPLEMENTATION: 
1. Created database analysis scripts to examine 414 soft-deleted assets
2. Identified 282 non-image assets (documents, videos, audio) vs 132 image assets
3. Restored non-image assets by setting deleted_at = NULL for file types:
   - Documents (PDFs, Word, Excel, PowerPoint, etc.): 143 files
   - Videos (MP4, MOV, AVI, WebM, etc.): 73 files  
   - Audio (MP3, WAV, OGG, AAC, etc.): 49 files
   - SVG and other non-raster formats: 17 files
4. Kept 132 image assets soft-deleted due to actual storage file issues
5. Verified final state: 286 active assets, 132 deleted (mainly images)

RESULTS:
- Successfully restored 282 non-image assets that should be visible in UI
- These assets will display with file type icons instead of thumbnails
- Downloads may fail if storage files missing, but assets are browsable
- Only actual image assets with storage problems remain deleted
- Fixed the overly aggressive deletion that removed all non-image content
