GOAL: Implement UI improvements to AssetFilters component - convert upload date fields to 2-column layout and replace Collections checkbox list with searchable multi-select dropdown.

IMPLEMENTATION: 
1. Updated upload date section to use CSS Grid (grid-cols-2 gap-4) for side-by-side date inputs
2. Replaced Collections checkbox list with custom searchable multi-select dropdown using DaisyUI classes:
   - Added dropdown state management (collectionsDropdownOpen, collectionsSearchTerm)
   - Implemented dropdown button with selection count display
   - Added search input with Search icon from Lucide React
   - Created scrollable options list with checkbox selections
   - Added proper blur handling to close dropdown when clicking outside
   - Implemented search filtering functionality
   - Updated Filter Summary to display collection names instead of IDs
   - Added proper state cleanup on clear all filters
3. Used DaisyUI components and styling:
   - btn btn-outline for dropdown trigger
   - dropdown-content menu with proper z-index and styling
   - Search icon integration with proper positioning
   - Consistent spacing and hover effects
4. Maintained all existing functionality while improving UX and space efficiency

Technical Details:
- Added ChevronDown and Search icons to imports
- Implemented controlled dropdown with React state
