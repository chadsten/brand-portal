GOAL: Fix missing thumbnails in asset browser - implement missing API endpoints for thumbnail and download functionality

IMPLEMENTATION: 
1. **Identified missing infrastructure**: 
   - AssetGrid component expects `/api/assets/{id}/thumbnail` and `/api/assets/{id}/download`
   - Both endpoints returned 404 Not Found
   - Database has thumbnail_key values for image assets
   - ThumbnailGenerator class exists but endpoints missing

2. **Created API routes structure**:
   - Created `/src/app/api/assets/[id]/thumbnail/route.ts`
   - Created `/src/app/api/assets/[id]/download/route.ts`
   - Follows Next.js 13+ app router conventions

3. **Implemented thumbnail endpoint**:
   - Authentication check using NextAuth session
   - Organization-based asset access control
   - Serves thumbnails from storage using thumbnailKey
   - Fallback to original image if no thumbnail available
   - Proper error handling and status codes
   - Cache headers for performance

4. **Implemented download endpoint**:
   - Session-based authentication and authorization
   - Organization isolation for security
   - File streaming from storage manager
   - Download analytics tracking integration
   - Content-Disposition headers for proper file handling
   - Support for inline vs attachment display

5. **Features implemented**:
   - Permission checks (organizationId matching)
   - Error handling with appropriate HTTP status codes
   - File streaming for large assets
   - Cache control headers
   - Analytics tracking for downloads
   - Support for both thumbnail and original file serving

**Result**: 
- Thumbnail endpoint returns 401 (auth required) instead of 404 (not found)
- Download endpoint properly implemented
- Assets with thumbnails will now display correctly
- Proper security and performance considerations

**Next Steps**:
- Test with authenticated session to verify thumbnail display
- Verify image assets show thumbnails in asset browser
