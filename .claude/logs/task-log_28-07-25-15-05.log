GOAL: Complete the HeroUI to DaisyUI conversion for AssetTagging.tsx and fix all TypeScript errors

IMPLEMENTATION: 
- Systematically converted all remaining HeroUI components to DaisyUI equivalents:
  - Modal/ModalContent/ModalHeader/ModalBody/ModalFooter → dialog with modal-box/modal-header/modal-body/modal-action classes
  - Card/CardBody/CardHeader → div with card/card-body/card-header classes  
  - Button → button with btn classes and appropriate variants (btn-primary, btn-outline, etc.)
  - Tabs/Tab → DaisyUI tabs pattern with conditional rendering based on selectedTab
  - Chip → span with badge classes (badge-primary, badge-secondary, etc.)
  - Badge → span with badge classes
  - Divider → div with divider class
- Fixed JSX syntax errors from incomplete conversions
- Updated all text styling classes from HeroUI (text-default-500, text-small) to DaisyUI equivalents (text-base-content/60, text-sm)
- Maintained all existing functionality while using native HTML elements and DaisyUI classes
- Converted complex tab navigation from HeroUI Tabs component to DaisyUI pattern with button-based tab switching
- Fixed modal structures with proper dialog elements and modal backdrop handling
- Updated button interactions from onPress to onClick for native HTML compatibility
