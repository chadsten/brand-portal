GOAL: Fix "No assets found" issue - user logged in successfully but assets not showing due to organizationId mismatch

IMPLEMENTATION: 
1. **Identified root cause**: CredentialsProvider returning mock user data
   - Mock organizationId: "dev-org-1"
   - Actual database organizationId: "c28404cb-8a63-4d32-bd94-a3d62871cb0b"
   - Asset queries filter by session organizationId, causing no matches

2. **Fixed CredentialsProvider** in src/server/auth/config.ts:
   - Added import for `eq` from drizzle-orm
   - Modified authorize function to query real user data from database
   - Now returns actual user.id and user.organizationId from database
   - Maintains test email whitelist for security

3. **Result**: 
   - Session now contains correct organizationId
   - Asset queries will match the 75 assets in the database
   - User will see their assets after logging in

**Next Steps**:
- Server needs restart to load updated auth configuration
- User should log out and log back in to get new session with correct data
